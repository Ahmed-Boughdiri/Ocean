## Introduction:
This Application is a react-time chat application for communities (something like Discord), in which users can create a room, and participate in other available rooms.  
The main objective of this platform is to gather people with the same interests and allow them to share their opinion and thoughts, and also interact with others in the same community.

---

## Technical Insights:
This app is built using express.js and MongoDB, also relies heavily of course on socket communication using socket.io, and it took almost a week to completely develop the application.
